# chick

The model is based on a neural network implementation of the TD(0) reinforcement learning actor-critic architecture. The model is base on the work in [Mannella, F., & Baldassarre, G. (2006). A Neural-Network Reinforcement-Learning Model of Domestic Chicks that Learn to Localise the Centre of Closed Arenas. Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London B - Biological Sciences](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2006.1966), which aims to reproduce and understand the behaviors of domestic chicks in experiments where they are trained to locate food in different-sized arenas. The model provides insights into the chicks' navigation behaviors and suggests possible cognitive mechanisms underlying their actions.
